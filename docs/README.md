## FOO: The Flaws of Others 

### Overview
FOO is an algorithm that minimizes false information in ensembles of Large Laguage Models (LLMs) agents.  See  the manuscript *A Mathematical Theory of Discursive Networks*    [arXiv: 2507.06565](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06565) DOI: [10.48550/arXiv.2507.06565](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2507.06565)

This repository provides a comprehensive Python framework for multi-agent AI interactions, supporting different types of LLMs. The system features a modular architecture with command-line interfaces, advanced GUI applications, and sophisticated multi-agent orchestration capabilities. All scripts use standard environment variable credentials and support conversational workflows, document processing, vulnerability analysis, and collaborative agent consensus mechanisms.

### Core System Architecutre
The architecture of FOO (Flaws of Others) is organized into the following main components:

1. Agent Layer
    - Description of individual LLM agents and their role (e.g., responding, debating, fact-checking).
    - Include whether these agents are homogenous or diverse in model type or configuration.

Coordination Module

Responsible for managing dialogue flow, initiating tasks, and dispatching prompts.

May include a voting system or argumentation mechanism.

Knowledge and Memory System

Shared knowledge base across agents.

May include vector DB, retrieval augmentation, or long-term memory.

Evaluation/Consensus Layer

Mechanism for detecting hallucinations or inconsistencies.

Final decision-making processâ€”e.g., via majority vote, confidence scoring, or agent debate.

User Interface / Interaction Gateway

CLI, GUI, or API through which users interact with the system.

Presents outputs, allows configuration, and displays internal state.

Data Input / Preprocessing

Handles documents, questions, or vulnerabilities submitted by users.

Parses and routes input to appropriate modules.

Security and Verification

(If present in your diagram) component for ensuring output robustness and detecting malicious input or agent manipulation.

Logging and Monitoring

Tracks conversations, decisions, and agent activity for debugging and transparency.
